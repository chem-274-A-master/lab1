# Chem 274A - Lab 1

In this lab, you will be using the molecular simulation code we wrote in Chem 280 - Foundations of Molecular Modelling and Software Engineering.

## Exercises

## Section 1 - Makefile (Spend 30 minutes max on this)
1. Review the Makefile in `mcsim_python`. Write a comment above each target explaining what the target does.
2. Use the `makefile` to create an environment for this lab. 
3. Activate the environment created by the `makefile`
4. Use the `makefile` to install `mcsim`

## Section 2 - Runnning Simulations
1. Use the notebook `run_mcsim.ipynb` to run Monte Carlo simulations. Follow the instructions in the notebook.
