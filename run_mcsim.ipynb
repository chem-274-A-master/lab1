    "# Running Monte Carlo Simulations with MC Sim\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course Chem 280, we developed the foundational code for running Monte Carlo simulations focused on Lennard-Jones fluids. \n",
    "This code has now been encapsulated in a Python package named `mcsim`, which allows for a more streamlined user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those in need of a refresher, Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique used to model complex systems. \n",
    "In the context of a Lennard-Jones fluid, we begin by generating an initial configuration, or set of coordinates, that represents a system of atoms placed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. \n",
    "Further configurations are then generated by proposing random moves for individual particles. Whether these new configurations are accepted depends on the change in system energy as calculated by the Lennard-Jones potential, along with a probabilistic factor for higher-energy states. \n",
    "This is an extremely simplified overview, but this is just a refresher!\n",
    "\n",
    "The configurations generated can then be analyzed to determine various system properties like pressure or structural information. \n",
    "One type of analysis is the Radial Distribution Function (RDF). \n",
    "This lesson guide will walk you through how to use the `mcsim` package to perform and analyze such simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will generate some programming concepts you haven't seen before, but don't worry, we will learn about them in Chem 274A. \n",
    "Try not to get bogged down in the lines of code, \n",
    "but instead look at how we would run a simulation and the simulation results. We are happy to answer any coding questions you have, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "1. Gain a deeper understanding of the Radial Distribution Function and its role in molecular simulations.\n",
    "2. Acquire the skills to set up and run molecular simulations effectively.\n",
    "3. Learn to run simulations using various input parameters and make comparative analyses of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 0: Package installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to complete the Makefile exercise outlined in the `README` and activate the appropriate environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: The Radial Distribution Function (RDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Radial Distribution Function (RDF) is a critical concept in molecular simulations, providing insight into the spatial arrangement of atoms in the system. Specifically, the RDF tells us about how atom density varies as a function of distance from a reference atom. Understanding the RDF can help us grasp the structural organization of systems at the molecular or atomic scale. For a more on [this webpage](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Molecular_Simulation/Radial_Distribution_Functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, different phases of matter (solid, liquid, gas) exhibit different shaped RDFs, example shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"rdf_argon_phases.png\"  style=\"width:400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the RDF to evaluate the structure of the Lennard Jones fluid under different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Steps for Running a Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few cells walk you through running a simultaion with the `mcsim` package (included in this repository).\n",
    "After you have been walked through the steps, there are exercises for you to complete at the end of the notebook where you will \n",
    "vary your simulation parameters and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular simulations are typically done following a particular procedure, outlined below.\n",
    "This will also be relevant for our next lab, where we will run molecular dynamics simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import Required Packages\n",
    "Before running any simulation, you'll need to import the relevant Python packages, including `mcsim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Set System Parameters\n",
    "For every simulation, a few essential system parameters must be set, such as the number of atoms in the system, the density, and the temperature. Properly tuning these parameters is crucial for the simulation's accuracy and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Set Simulation Parameters\n",
    "Additional settings specific to the simulation need to be defined. These include:\n",
    "  - **Number of Steps**: This specifies the number of trial moves for generating configurations. These trial moves may or may not be accepted, based on the resulting system energy.\n",
    "  - **Simulation Cutoff**: This sets the maximum distance over which non-bonded interactions are calculated.\n",
    "  - **Maximum Particle Displacement**: This is the upper limit on how far a particle may be moved during each configuration trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Equilibration Simulation\n",
    "Before jumping into the production run, it's often useful to first run an equilibration simulation. This helps the system to reach a stable state where most observables fluctuate around mean values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Production Simulation\n",
    "Once equilibration is complete, you can proceed to the production simulation. This is the phase where data are collected for analysis,\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Analyze the simulation\n",
    "After you have run the simulation, you will analyze the generated coordinates. This can involve looking at the energies and analyzing the generated coordinates.nd it should only be run once the system has reached an equilibrium state.\n",
    "\n"
